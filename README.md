# Challenge01
[This an example](https://github.com/jimen8930/Challenge01/edit/main/README.md)
Description:
This code needed to be refactor to ensure this website is accesible for individuals with a disabilty. As I refactor the code, I made changes to the img to include alt attributes to specify what the each image displays so an individual who has a visual disability will know what each section of the website looks like. Also, I included titles to the a tag to describe the purpose of each link so that an individual with a disabilty will be able to navigate throgh the links as the sreen reader describes each link functions.
