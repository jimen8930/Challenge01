Description:

This code needed to be refactor to ensure this website is accesible for individuals with a disabilty. As I refactor the code, I made changes to the code to allow an individual with a disability to be able have the same benefits from the website as everyone else. Here are some of the changes that were made.
-I added to the img tag to include alt attributes to specify what each image displays so an individual who has a visual disability will know what each section of the website looks like.
-I included titles to the a tag to describe the purpose of each link so that an individual with a disabilty will be able to navigate throgh the links as the sreen reader describes each link functions. 
-I condensed the CSS files to reduced the size of the file and increased the perfromance of the website.
I made changes to the HTML file to include the appropriatee sematic tags and HTML attributes so the content is clearly defined.
I made comments to the CSS files to explain the purpose of the code. 

The purpose of refactoring a code is to improve the internal code which I did to ensure it is accessible for someone who has visual disability. THe small changes to internal code were made without altering the external behavior.
